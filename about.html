                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Sangrias Mexican Grill began in 2008 in Oshkosh, WI as a family restaurant with owners, Luis Vazquez, Shirley 
                        Vazquez and Sarah Gregory. Childhood recipes from Veracruz, Mexico became the inspiration for the authentic 
                        resort-style creations of Luis and his mother, Terri. Luis began cooking with his mother at a very early age and 
                        developed a passion and flare for creative cuisine utilizing a variety of seafood, meats, and vegetables which 
                        were readily available along the coastal regions of Mexico. He began operating his own businesses as a teenager and 
                        relocated to the United States to pursue his dream of working and owning a restaurant Shirley and Sarah were born 
                        and raised in Virginia and enjoy sharing their "southern hospitality" with guests. Their expertise with coordinating 
                        events, including weddings, rehearsals, business socials, catering, graduation and family celebrations have proven 
                        to be a dynamic addition to the team.
